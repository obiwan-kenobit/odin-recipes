## Project Description: Basic Recipe Website

In this project, I will be designing and developing a straightforward recipe website using basic HTML. The goal is to create a functional and accessible site that serves as a platform to share a collection of recipes.

### Project Scope

The website will feature:
- **Main Index Page**: The homepage will include an introduction and links to individual recipe pages.
- **Recipe Pages**: Each recipe will have its own dedicated page, detailing ingredients and preparation steps.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Structure the Main Index Page**:
   - Create a clean and simple HTML layout.
   - Include a list of links to the individual recipe pages.

2. **Design Individual Recipe Pages**:
   - For each recipe, create a separate HTML file.
   - Ensure each page contains clear sections for the recipe name, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.
   - Maintain a consistent layout across all recipe pages.

3. **Navigation and Usability**:
   - Implement straightforward navigation to allow users to move easily between the index page and recipe pages.
   - Ensure all links are functional and correctly point to their respective pages.

### Key Considerations

- **Simplicity**: The focus is on fundamental HTML coding without CSS styling, ensuring the content is accessible and easy to read.
- **Usability**: Ensure the website is intuitive and user-friendly, with clear navigation and logically organized content.

By adhering to these guidelines, I will create a basic yet effective recipe website that serves its intended purpose. The project will be an excellent exercise in mastering foundational HTML skills and structuring a simple web project.
