    <h1>Classic Italian Arrosto (Roast Beef)</h1>
    <img src="../img/arrosto.png" alt="a classic italian arrosto" width="650">
    <p>Classic Italian Arrosto is a traditional roast beef dish that is flavorful and aromatic. 
        It typically features a beef roast seasoned with garlic, fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme, and sage, 
        and then seared to lock in the flavors. The beef is roasted with vegetables such as potatoes, 
        carrots, and onions, and is often accompanied by a savory sauce made from white wine and beef broth.
         This dish is slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in tender, juicy meat that is perfect for family 
         gatherings or special occasions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>For the Beef:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 kg (3.3 lbs) beef roast (e.g., top round or sirloin)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh sage, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Vegetables:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>4 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 onions, quartered</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Preparation:</strong>
            <p>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Season the Beef:</strong>
            <p>In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic, rosemary, thyme, sage, salt, and pepper. Rub the beef roast with olive oil and then with the herb and garlic mixture. Make sure it’s evenly coated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sear the Beef:</strong>
            <p>Heat a large oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add a bit of olive oil and sear the beef roast on all sides until it’s browned. This helps to lock in the flavors and juices.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong>
            <p>In a separate bowl, toss the potatoes, carrots, and onions with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread the vegetables around the beef in the skillet or Dutch oven.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Roasting:</strong>
            <p>Pour the white wine and beef broth into the skillet or Dutch oven around the beef and vegetables. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil and transfer to the preheated oven.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cooking Time:</strong>
            <p>Roast in the oven for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the internal temperature of the beef reaches your desired level of doneness (medium-rare: 135°F, medium: 145°F, well-done: 160°F). Stir the vegetables occasionally to ensure they cook evenly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Resting the Beef:</strong>
            <p>Once cooked, remove the beef from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serving:</strong>
            <p>Slice the beef thinly against the grain. Serve with the roasted vegetables on the side, and drizzle with some of the pan juices for extra flavor.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For extra flavor, you can marinate the beef in the herb mixture overnight.</li>
        <li>Adjust the vegetables according to your preference; other good options include parsnips, bell peppers, or fennel.</li>
        <li>Ensure your roast rests before slicing to maintain its juiciness.</li>
    </ul>
